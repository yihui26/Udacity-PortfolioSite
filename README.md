This portfolio site is a Udacity final project for the "Intro to HTML and CSS" class:
https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-html-and-css--ud304 

We were supposed replicate the following site based on what we have learnt: https://storage.googleapis.com/supplemental_media/udacityu/3158088581/design-mockup-portfolio.pdf

My working version of the site can be found at the following URL:
https://yihui26.github.io/Udacity-PortfolioSite/index.html

It is overall a simple implementation if you follow the video, many thanks to the awesome instructors and examples. I took 3 days instead of the stipulated 3 weeks to finish this site, with most time spent on putting together portfolio projects to showcase. This is a free online course, feel free to try it too.
